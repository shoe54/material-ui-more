# material-ui-more

High-level React components built from material-ui components. Currently has a Proper Name popup component. Address popup component to come. This is very much work in progress.

What's next on my list: npmignore file so that src doesn't get included in the published npm module; host the demo.

## Pre-requisites

* Node
* Npm

## Building

    npm install
    npm run build
    npm run demobuild

To publish npm module, use `npm publish` after building.

## Running for development purposes

    npm run demodevbuild
    npm run demorun

You will need to execute the above commands in separate console windows as each command will stay running and watch for file changes
